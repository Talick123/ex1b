This program receives in the argument vectors, the name of a file and 
an integer. The program creates 2 child proccesses - one for bubble sort 
and the other for quick sort.
Each child creates an array with 50000 cells, inserts random integers and 
sorts them. Both children calculate the time it took them to sort the array
and print this result into the file sent in the argument vector.
The parent repeates this process of creating 2 children that sort the
array 50 times.
At the end of this process, the parent goes over the file in which
the results were printed and calculates the minimum, maximum and average
times for each sorting methods.
The parent prints in the command line these calculations and when it is 
finished it prints its own executable time. Before the program finishes, it 
deletes the file used.
deletes the file used.

Compile:   gcc -Wall ex1ba1.c -o ex1ba1
		   gcc -Wall ex1ba2.c -o ex1ba2
		   gcc -Wall ex1ba3.c -o ex1ba3

Run: ./ex1ba1.exe <filename> <integer>

Input: When running the executable file, add name of file and integer.
	   Example: ./ex1ba1.exe filename 17
	 

Output: Average bubble sort time, average quick sort time, 	
		minimum bubble sort time, minimum quick sort time, 
		maximum bubble sort time, maximum bubble sort time,
		Parent sort time.
		Example: 4.505360 4.520000 4.449000 0.006000 4.598000 4.598000
				228.755000
